# Demo_SSAL_SDP
Demo for the proposed SSAL-SDP method, i.e., superpixel-based semisupervised active learning (SSAL) method with the density peak (DP) augmentation, for the hyperspectral image classification.

This set of files contains the Matlab code for the superpixel based semisupervised active learning (SSAL) with the density peak (DP) augmentation proposed in the following paper:

The SLIC superpixel segmentation for hyperspectral images is implemented according to:

[2] Xiang Xu, Jun Li, Changshan Wu, Antonio Plaza,Regional clustering-based spatial preprocessing for hyperspectralunmixing. Remote Sensing of Environment,Vol.204, Pages 333-346, January 2018.

The compared method, i.e., SSAL-N is implemented following:

The LBP is implemented by:
